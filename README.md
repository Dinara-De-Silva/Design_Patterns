# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the **Design Patterns Repository**! If you're looking for well-organized code examples and notes on software design patterns, this repository is for you. It contains numerous examples of design patterns, making it a valuable resource for learners and developers alike.

## What are Design Patterns?

A **design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It provides a proven framework or template for solving a problem, ensuring the solution is robust and maintainable. Design patterns are broadly categorized into three types:

1. **Creational Design Patterns**  
2. **Structural Design Patterns**  
3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**

### Creational Design Patterns

Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation and tackle problems related to object instantiation. They aim to make the creation process more adaptable and reusable.  
Here are the **five creational design patterns**:

1. Singleton  
2. Factory Method  
3. Abstract Factory  
4. Builder  
5. Prototype

### Structural Design Patterns

Structural Design Patterns emphasize how classes and objects are composed to form larger, functional structures. They simplify object relationships, making code more efficient, flexible, and easy to maintain.  
Here are the **seven structural design patterns**:

1. Adapter  
2. Bridge  
3. Composite  
4. Decorator  
5. Facade  
6. Flyweight  
7. Proxy

### Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral Design Patterns focus on the interactions and communication between objects, ensuring their collaboration is efficient and understandable.  
Here are the **ten behavioral design patterns**:

1. Chain of Responsibility  
2. Command  
3. Interpreter  
4. Iterator  
5. Mediator  
6. Memento  
7. Observer  
8. State  
9. Strategy  
10. Template Method
